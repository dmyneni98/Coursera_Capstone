# Coursera_Capstone
Introduction/ Business Problem 

  The car accident severity dataset is provided which gives the severity of the car accident based on the fatality of the occured accident. It also has many different types of attributes which could have contributes to the causation of the accident as well as the fatality. For this capstone project, I am going to use the data given to hypothesize which of the conditions during the drive has the highest rate of accident occuring versus which conditions result in the highest number of fatalities. This could be used to caution the drivers on the road when those conditions are present to decrease the amount of accidents that occur in the future. It could also be used to increase the amount of police presence on the road during these specific conditions to oversee whether the drivers are driving at a lower speed during those hazardous conditions.
  
Data

  The dataset that is given is called ca accident severity. It has many attributes as well as the fatality of the car accidents. Some attributes that are included are location, weather condition, car speeding, light conditions, road conditions, whether the place of the accident was a junction, number of people involved and number of vehicles involved. I would be using all of the above attributes by posing them against the fatality of the occuring accidents as well as the amount of accidents that occured. 
  
Methodology

  For this project, I used bar plots to visualize the categorical data given. I plotted the variables addresstype, weather, light conditions and road conditions as four seperate bar plots. With the severity of the accidents as the series and count as the y variables. This helped me perform exploritory analysis on the data with the visualization tools to help me analyze the data to see which conditions correlated with more accidents as well as the severity of the accidents.

Results

  Results for this project were bar plots that clearly display the conditions in which the driver was driving versus the count of the severity of the accident.

Discussion 

  Based on the bar plots, for the address type block has a lot more accidents that resulted in property damage more than any kind of injury. While accidents that occured at an intersection had almost an equal number of accidents that resulted in injury versus accidents that resulted in property damage. Alleys had very minimal amount of accidents that only resulted in property damage but this could be attributed to the fact that alleys are not part of the roads that are generally travelled often. Alleys are also close to building, so they generally have lower speed limits as well as drivers being more conscious because they are generally not well lit either. 
  
  The bar plot results for the correlation between weather conditions and accident severity surprised me because most amount of accidents occured when the weather was clear. I hypothesized that most accidents would occur during the rain or snow because of the lower visibility. But the bar plots display that most accidents occured when the sky was clear with the accidents that only had property damange being almost double the amount of accidents that had injuries that occured. The blowing sand and dirt, smoke, crosswind, freezing rain and snowing had almost no accidents occuring during those times, this could be attributed to the fact that Seattle does not endure those weather conditions often. Also it is known that if it does snow, it snows very heavily, so more often schools and offices can be cancelled or work from home. Seattle's weather also has overcast cast and raining conditions often which also has some amount of accidents occuring but most that result in property damage rather than injury.
  
  The bar plot that visualizes light conditions versus the count and severity of the accident coincides with my predictions that most accidents occur during day time but with less severity because there are more people on the road but the accidents that occur at night time are less in frequency. Both accidents that occured during day time and night had almost twice as many accidents that resulted in just property damange versus accidents that resulted in injury as well. 
  
  This bar plot if comparable to the bar plot that showed correlation between weather conditions and accident severity. This plot shows the correlation between road conditions and the count of the severity of the accident. Opposite to what I predicted, dry conditions had more accidents but the accidents that resulted in property damange were almost twice as many as those that resulted in injury as well. This condition applied to the accidents that occured when roads were wet as well. This could be due to the fact that people go faster when the road are in better conditions for driving. 
  
Conclusion 
  
  Finally, I would caution people to be more careful when the weather and road conditions are more favorable because more people go at higher speeds as well as more people being on the road itself. I would recommend that the police have more presence on the road when the sky is clear, during the daytime and when the road is dry because my analysis portrayed that more accidents that result only in property damage as well as more accidents that result in injury occur when the conditions that a driver is driving in are more favorable.
